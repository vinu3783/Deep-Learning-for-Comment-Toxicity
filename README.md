# Deep-Learning-for-Comment-Toxicity
🧠 Deep Learning for Comment Toxicity Detection with Streamlit
📌 Project Overview
Toxic comments such as harassment, hate speech, and offensive language are major challenges in online platforms.
This project builds a Deep Learning-based Comment Toxicity Detection system with a Streamlit web app for real-time moderation.

The model analyzes user comments and predicts the likelihood of toxicity, helping moderators, businesses, and educators maintain healthier online environments.

🎯 Problem Statement
Online communities need automated systems to detect and filter toxic comments in real time.
This project develops such a system using Deep Learning + NLP, integrated with Streamlit for usability.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time toxicity prediction for user comments
✅ Interactive Streamlit Web App
✅ Bulk comment analysis via CSV upload
✅ Model insights and performance metrics visualization
✅ Deployable for social media, forums, e-learning, news sites, and brand safety
